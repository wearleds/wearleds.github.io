WEAR-LEDs are small LEDs that can be attached to your clothes. They are thin and flexible and can be sewn or glued to fabric. Every LED can show any color and all LEDs can show different colors at the same time.

#Step by Step Instructions

* Iron (or sew) three lines of conductive fabric to your clothing. The + and - lines are continuos lines and the DATA line connects the output of one LED to the input of the next one.
* Attach the WEAR-LEDs to the conductive fabric. Just make sure that all LEDs have the same orientation, so that all arrows point in the same direction.
* Add the connector and connect the micro-controller to it.
* Power the micro-controller with a 5V USB power source. This can be a USB battery.
